# Midterm exam

## adara.sh 

It is a bash script that utilizes mafft to create an amino acid alignment, custom python scripts provided to us so we can create a codon alignment. We also used RAxML to generate a phylogentic tree from a DNA fasta file using a python script, drawTree.py 

## adra_aa.png
 
This is the phylogenetic tree for amino acid that was generated through RAxML and drawTree.py

## adra_codon.png

This is	the phylogenetic tree for codon that was generated through RAxML and drawTree.py

## joinedADRA2.aa.mafft.aln.fas

The alignment made for the amino acid sequence of my joinedADRA2.fas using mafft. 

## joinedADRA2.codon.aln.fas

The alignment made for the codon sequence of my joinedADRA2.fas using *reverseTranslateAlignment.py*  

## joinedADRA2.fas 

The fasta file produced in week3 homework that contains DNA sequences of ADARA2A, ADARA2B, ADARA2C, and DRD2 from human, cow, desert tortoise, ostrich, chicken, and spotted gar
